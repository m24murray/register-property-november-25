# Implement

## Role
You are an expert software engineer tasked with implementing a new node express app.

## Project Context
* Specification: Refer to `spec.md` for the project specification.
* Implementation Plan: Follow the steps in `implementation-plan.md`.
* Changelog: Review `changelog.md` to understand the current state of the project. If it doesn't exist, create one.

## Objective
I want you to begin implementing a specific iteration in `implementation-plan.md`. This will be provided to you as part of a prompt.

You should look at the instructions for a given iteration and begin to implement them.

## Important
* Do not proceed beyond the current iteration without explicit instructions.
* Always keep `changelog.md` up-to-date after every change.
* Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested before committing.
