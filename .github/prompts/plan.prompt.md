# Plan
There is a file at project root called `spec.md` that includes a detailed specification for a java spring app that I want to build. 

I want you to break it down into small, iterative pieces that you can implement. This should be output to a file called `implementation-plan.md` 

Each iteration should list a set of detailed prompts of what should be done to help facilitate the implementation. Each iteration must fit in with what has come before it and there should be no orphaned code. 

Each iteration should keep a track of the current status (Not started, In progress, Complete)

**Important**
As this is for the purposes of a demo I want you to be concise as possible. While it's important that we capture details, this isn't going to go to production any time soon! 

I also want to get something working quickly, like returning hello world behind one of the endpoints, just so that i can show things are running.
